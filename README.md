# us_rf_processing

## Datasets

Here are stored ultrasound rf signals, mostly in npz to facilitate loading information. Accompanying images may contain metadata about the data acquisition. 

* [A simple echo](/data/simple_echo/) contains a simple echo. 
* [Data from a mechanical probe](/data/probeX/) .. as it says.
* [NDT acquisitons](/data/NDT_stairs) on a steel block.
 

## Experiments and notebooks 

* [00. RF Processing](/00.RF_Processing.ipynb): Showcasing how to rebuild a B-mode ultrasound image from an ultrasound probe.
* [01. NDT Processing](/01.NDT_Processing.ipynb): Playing with NDT phantoms
